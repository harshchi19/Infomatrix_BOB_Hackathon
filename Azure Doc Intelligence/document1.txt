INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of XYZ Corporation
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of XYZ Corporation, which comprise
the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, and the related statements of income, changes in
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the
financial statements.
Revenue Recognition Our audit procedures included a thorough examination of the
company's revenue recognition practices. We employed advanced machine learning
techniques to classify revenue transactions, assessing their alignment with established
criteria as per IFRS 15. Our model flagged 237 transactions, representing 3.5% of total
revenue, for further review due to potential misalignment with recognition criteria.
Related Party Transactions We conducted an extensive analysis of the company's
transactions to identify potential related party dealings. Our model, utilizing a
comprehensive database of known related parties, identified 18 transactions that met the
criteria for related party classification under IAS 24. These transactions, totaling $12.7 million,
were subjected to additional scrutiny to ensure proper disclosure and arm's length terms.
Going Concern Assessment In evaluating the company's ability to continue as a going
concern, we assessed various financial and operational factors. Our analysis revealed that the
company's current ratio has improved from 1.2 to 1.8 over the past year, and operating cash
flows have increased by 30%. These indicators suggest strong financial health. Based on our
assessment, we conclude that there is no substantial doubt about the entity's ability to
continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time (not to exceed one year beyond
the date of the financial statements).
Materiality In planning and performing our audit, we determined materiality based on 1% of
total assets, resulting in an overall materiality threshold of $10 million. We identified 3
adjustments exceeding our materiality threshold, which were communicated to management.
After recording these adjustments, there were no remaining uncorrected misstatements
exceeding our materiality threshold.
Conclusion In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of XYZ Corporation as of December 31, 2023, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards.
